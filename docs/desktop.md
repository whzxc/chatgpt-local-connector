# Desktop lifecycle

Connector Desktop is a Tauri/Rust GUI and tray client of the standalone Rust Core. One file-locked Core per state directory owns connections, execution and statistics; local plugins share that owner. Desktop and plugin must use the same native build. No Node runtime ships with either.

- **Connect:** Desktop mode ensures Desktop is available; background mode initializes Connector's app-server without opening Desktop. Official mode starts Tunnel Client, which launches Core's native forwarding adapter as needed. HTTPS mode starts a separate MCP listener and the configured Cloudflare/ngrok client. Tunnel management and auxiliary RPC use Desktop's bundled native Codex binary directly, without npm launcher scripts.
- **Disconnect:** stops only the selected ingress process group and MCP forwarding; Connector app-server and Agent processes continue until core shutdown. Unconfirmed requests retain receipts and must not be automatically retried as unexecuted.
- **Close window:** hides it while keeping the connection running. Reopen through the macOS menu bar/Dock or Windows tray.
- **Quit:** remembers which connections are running and releases Desktop's Core lease. The final local lease closing stops Connector-owned processes; an active plugin can keep Core running. Opening the app again restores those connections; connections left disconnected remain disconnected.
- **Start at sign-in:** the OS starts the native app and connects it.
- **Update:** downloads and verifies the signature, requires other local entrypoints to close, then drains Core, installs, and restarts. Codex Desktop task ownership does not change.

The home view places control sources on the left, the shared Connector in the center, and installed, supported Agents on the right. Each line shows its own status; an installed Agent can remain on standby. The top Connect/Disconnect button starts enabled ingresses or stops running ingresses. Click a built-in platform icon to open its website, or its line status icon to edit the connection, or use the plus button to add ChatGPT, Notion, Slack, or a custom MCP client. Each source has its own connection dialog with save, connect, disconnect, and remove actions. Applicable authentication and listener fields are displayed directly. Platform and display name are separate: the chosen platform stays fixed, and every source has an editable name; only ChatGPT offers OpenAI Tunnel. The editor reads back that ingress’s API key as a password, while other blank secret fields preserve saved credentials. General Settings contains application preferences; Agents management and its separate settings panel open from the home graph.

On Windows, left-clicking the tray icon opens and focuses the main window. Right-clicking opens a native menu containing connection status, Open, Tasks, Records, Settings and Quit. Connection status is read-only and refreshes every five seconds; an unavailable backend is shown as unknown. Open shows the overview, and the other navigation items open their corresponding pages. Windows does not create a tray usage panel.

On macOS, clicking the menu-bar icon toggles a subscription usage panel. It shows
scrollable subscription cards.
Quota blocks, usage rows and warning icons open secondary detail bubbles; the
header itself has no hover details. Scrolling dismisses open detail bubbles.

The panel follows the application theme and locale. It anchors to the tray icon,
keeps within the monitor work area and chooses the side with space for details.
Secondary details reuse the same web popover as the browser preview, including
rounded corners, curved pointer, theme and animated transitions. The native window
reserves a transparent side area for these bubbles; hovering never resizes or
moves the primary panel. A short reveal delay and leave grace allow moving between
a row and its details. Closing the panel also hides its details. Window captures
include the transparent area reserved for details.
The panel uses 14px content padding and spacing.
Escape, an outside click or loss of focus closes it. The native Options menu contains connection status, Settings, Share Screenshot,
Check for Updates, About and Quit. Share Screenshot copies a 4x image of one
provider’s displayed quota and usage rows to the clipboard, with the current
appearance and Local Connector branding. It does not capture other windows.
Update checks use the main window’s existing update flow; errors remain visible.

Automatically open Codex tasks is enabled by default. Creation persists a temporary empty seed before opening the task page for Desktop execution; sending, continuation, and interruption use the Desktop owner's IPC. When disabled, new tasks are created and run directly in Connector's app-server, without Desktop IPC or guaranteed Desktop continuation/interruption. Existing tasks retain their owner. Read-only background task queries do not resume execution. After Connector restarts, explicitly sending new input resumes the session; unconfirmed requests are never replayed automatically.

Connection is not gated by Desktop version numbers. It still validates the IPC protocol, socket/named-pipe user, task owner, and response source. Incompatibility returns the actual error without bypassing checks or taking ownership. External task management supports macOS and Windows. On Windows, Connector detects the current user's Microsoft Store Codex Desktop and verifies the named-pipe server process belongs to that installation. To avoid WindowsApps execution restrictions, Desktop's bundled CLI and helpers are copied by content hash into Connector's private data directory. Tasks open through the OS-registered `codex://` links.

The local management HTTP server binds only to a random `127.0.0.1` port and validates Host, Origin, and a random credential. Port and credential are stored in the private state directory for stdio/development preview. Frontend assets are embedded in Tauri; no Node web server runs.

Development builds use a separate identifier and icon and forward reads/writes to the running built app. If it is unavailable, they report an unavailable backend instead of starting an independent business connection. See [development](development.md).

First use requires Codex Desktop installation/sign-in, official Tunnel or HTTPS configuration, and adding/enabling the connection in ChatGPT. The app prepares the selected connection components. Existing Codex sign-in can be reused but does not replace provider credentials or web connection setup. See the [README](../README.md#let-codex-set-it-up-recommended) and [connection guide](tunnel.md).

Available subscriptions are monitored by default by the shared core independently
of connections and Agent execution permissions. Enabling the quota panel enables
monitoring of supported sources. When none are available, its settings explain
why the panel is absent. macOS can show an independent non-activating edge rail after the
feature is enabled. Closing the main window keeps monitoring and the rail alive;
The rail window follows the visible capsule and bubble bounds for window screenshots.
Hiding the rail leaves monitoring active; disabling subscription monitoring stops quota refreshes. Both preserve the usual
Dock/menu-bar entry points. See [Subscription usage](subscriptions.md).
