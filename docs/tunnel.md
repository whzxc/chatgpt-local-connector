# Connect control sources: OpenAI Tunnel and HTTPS MCP

Multiple control-source ingresses can run concurrently against one Core. Add or edit each source independently from the home topology, or use `cli ingress`; authentication, tool policy, provider configuration, verification, and lifecycle belong to that ingress. Fixed HTTPS entries bind their own configured loopback port, so entries that share a host must use distinct ports and matching reverse-proxy routes.

Return to the [project home](../README.md). For assisted setup, send the home page's message to local Codex and follow the [setup and troubleshooting guide](codex-setup.md). ChatGPT onboarding defaults to the official OpenAI Secure Tunnel; other control sources normally use HTTPS MCP according to the [support matrix](control-sources.md). The instructions below cover manual setup. Add or open a control source from the native app's home topology. Missing connection components are prepared automatically; you do not need to create provider profiles manually.

## HTTPS MCP

When adding or editing a control source, select HTTPS MCP and choose a provider. Authentication is configured per ingress as **None**, **Bearer**, or **OAuth**; choose a mode supported by the target client and CLC, as documented in the [control source support matrix](control-sources.md). OAuth uses CLC's local authorization server and owner consent; see [OAuth authentication](oauth.md). This project does not provide a hosted relay.

| Provider | Required information | Managed by the app | Boundaries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cloudflare · Temporary domain | None | Downloads cloudflared, starts a Quick Tunnel, obtains a public URL | No account or domain; the URL may change on reconnect. For trials, without availability guarantees |
| Cloudflare · Fixed domain | Tunnel Token and domain | Downloads cloudflared and runs a named Tunnel using the entered domain | Your Cloudflare account must have the domain and a configured public route |
| ngrok | Account Authtoken | Downloads ngrok, starts a tunnel, obtains the account's public URL | Requires an ngrok account; its traffic, request, and concurrency limits apply |
| Pinggy | None for temporary; Token and assigned domain for fixed | Downloads Pinggy CLI, starts and stops the ingress tunnel | Fixed domains must already be assigned to the token |
| LocalXpose | Access Token and reserved domain | Downloads loclx, starts a tunnel and discovers its HTTPS URL | Fixed domains only; the domain must already exist |
| Custom domain | Public MCP URL | Starts the local MCP listener | You provide a domain, valid TLS certificate, and reverse proxy |

### Cloudflare temporary domain / ngrok

1. Select Cloudflare, or choose ngrok and use Get token to obtain your Authtoken.
2. Select Save and reconnect. The app prepares official components and runs the tunnel with a separate random loopback port and temporary configuration. Existing cloudflared/ngrok configuration is unchanged.
3. Open that ingress's connection details and copy its MCP URL into the target MCP client. Configure the same authentication mode selected for the ingress: None requires no credential, Bearer uses the generated ingress token, and OAuth follows the client's authorization flow. For ChatGPT, the home setup guide can open Plugins; alternatively, provide an authorized signed-in browser session for Codex to complete supported client-side setup using `cli onboarding`.
4. Use the ingress verification message from the setup flow and call `connector_verify` from the actual control source. CLC confirms receipt of the matching code for that ingress. If a temporary URL changes, update or recreate that client's MCP connection; verification for the old public identity does not carry over.

Cloudflare temporary domain uses [Quick Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/). It is intended for trials and does not support a separate SSE stream; CLC's native MCP uses JSON POST and does not rely on SSE. cloudflared needs outbound access to Cloudflare on port 7844; an ordinary HTTP proxy should not be assumed to carry its data traffic. For a lasting address, use Cloudflare fixed domain, ngrok, or a custom domain. Manage ngrok accounts, domains, and quotas through [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download); the app does not create paid resources.

Components are downloaded from official HTTPS sources and cached locally. Cloudflare downloads are checked against official SHA256 values. ngrok downloads come from the official download site; a local SHA256 detects cached-file corruption. The Authtoken is used only by the ngrok client, never sent to the MCP control source or placed in command arguments or ordinary status responses. Disconnecting, startup failure, or quitting stops the tunnel and MCP listener and removes temporary runtime configuration.

ngrok offers Temporary domain and Fixed domain modes; both use only an Authtoken. Temporary mode automatically obtains an ngrok-assigned address, which may change after restart and require updating the MCP client. In Fixed domain mode, enter a domain already configured in your ngrok account (or an HTTPS origin without a path). The app starts the tunnel using that domain and provides the `/mcp` URL. It does not query account domains, provision domains, or create paid resources. If the fixed domain is unavailable, startup fails without falling back to a temporary address.

### Pinggy / LocalXpose

Both providers use the same Save, start, stop, and Get again flow. Their official clients are downloaded only on first use and cached outside the app bundle; no Node.js installation is required. Pinggy release assets are checked against official SHA256 values. LocalXpose uses official HTTPS downloads and local cache hashes.

Pinggy temporary mode needs no token. Fixed mode requires a token with an assigned persistent domain. LocalXpose requires an Access Token and an existing reserved or custom domain. Temporary mode is unavailable because its first MCP request is redirected away from `/mcp`. The app does not purchase plans or reserve domains. A fixed-domain mismatch fails without selecting another URL.

Provider credentials are separate from the ingress's MCP authentication. Pinggy receives its token through a private configuration file and uses CLC-owned daemon state. LocalXpose receives its token through the child process environment. Neither credential appears in command arguments or status. Stopping a Pinggy ingress targets only its tunnel; it does not stop the user's Pinggy daemon or other tunnels.
